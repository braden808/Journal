					<h4>How I feel about it</h4>
					<p>
						When I first started working with HTML's and CSS I was very confused.  I started to listen more in class and tried to pick up as much content I could pick up per day.  I am pretty confident working with HTML's and CSS now.  Perfect practice makes perfect.
