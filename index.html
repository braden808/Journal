					<h4>How I feel about it</h4>
					<p>
						When I first started working with HTML's and CSS I was very confused.  I started to listen more in class and tried to pick up as much content I could pick up per day.  I am pretty confident working with HTML's and CSS now.  Perfect practice makes perfect.

					<h4>What is Media Queries?</h4>
					<p>
						Media Queries are used to create responsive design.  When you create media querries then at a certain amount of pixels to another certain part amount pixels you can change the design, layout, and look of your website.  Think about it as a break in your layout.  The great divide.

					<h4>What did you learn about javasript?</h4>
					<p>
						Java script is the function of a website.  This language uses variables that have different values like strings, integers, and booleans.  A string is like word values.  An integer is a number value.  A boolean is a true or false statement.  using these variables will add unique fuction the interact with the html and CSS.

					<h4>Aliens Activity</h4>

				<h2>Verison App Challenge (REmoji)</h2>
				<h6>November 28</h6>
				<div class="article">
					<img class="avatar" width="250" height="125 " src="http://cerebral-overload.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Verizon.jpg">
					<h4>Problem</h4>
					<p>
						Reminder apps are too plain.  Regular reminders does not catch the users attention and causes the user to forget.
					</p>
					
					<h4>Solution</h4>
					<p>
						Our app uses emojis to catch the users attention.  The emojis change as the time passes during the users set reminder.
					</p>

					<h4>Video Improvement</h4>
					<p>
						I would increase the volume in some sections of the video because it is soft in some sections.
					</p>

					<h4>Current Features</h4>
					<p>
						The REmoji app uses time responsive emojis to catch the users attention.  Timer is set like a regular reminder app.  Also a point system to unlock new emojis.
					</p>

					<h4>New Features</h4>
					<p>
						A new feature that I would like to add is a feature that will let them create their own emoji making it fun for every user.
					</p>

					<h4>Challenges</h4>
					<p>
						Our team faced some problems like time issues because time was limited.  Also we had to record off a cell phone.
					</p>

					<h4>Changes</h4>
					<p>
						If I were to do this again I would start much earlier and record off a camera for better quality.  Also edit off a computer for a better finished product.

				<div class="article">
					<img class="avatar" width="250" height="125 " src="http://funintelligenttraining.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Winter-Break.jpg">
					<h4>Summary</h4>
					<p>
						In this semester I learned so much.  First we learned about HTML structure and we created this journal blog.  Then we started to work on CSS to create the design and layout of our journal.  After a bunch of stress and tests, we finally moved on to javascript.  Javascript is the function to a website.  Overall I learned so much this semester and this class as a whole took big steps into the coding direction.  I am very glad that I took this class.  Thank you to my Instructors!  Ms. Torneros, Ms.Ramirez, and R.I.P Mr.Tan.
